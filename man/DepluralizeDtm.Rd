\title{Run the CorrectS function on columns of a document term matrix.}
\usage{
DepluralizeDtm(dtm, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dtm}{A document term matrix of class \code{dgCMatrix} whose colnames are tokens}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass to \code{TmParallelApply}. See note, below.}
}
\value{
Returns a document term matrix of class \code{dgCMatrix}. The columns index
the de-pluralized tokens of the input document term matrix. In other words,
there will generally be fewer columns in the returned matrix than the
input matrix
}
\description{
Turns pluralizations of words in the columns of a document term 
matrix to their singular form. Then aggregates all columns that now have the 
same token. See example below.
}
\note{
This function performs parallel computation by default. The default 
behavior is to use all available cores according to \code{parallel::detectCores()}.
However, this can be modified by passing the \code{cpus} argument when calling
this function.
