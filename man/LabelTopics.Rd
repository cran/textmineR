\title{Get some topic labels using a "more probable" method of terms}
\usage{
LabelTopics(assignments, dtm, M = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{assignments}{A documents by topics matrix similar to \code{theta}. 
This will work best if this matrix is sparse, with only a few non-zero topics 
per document.}

\item{dtm}{A document term matrix of class \code{matrix} or \code{dgCMatrix}.
The columns of \code{dtm} should be n-grams whose colnames have a "_" where
spaces would be between the words.}

\item{M}{The number of n-gram labels you want to return. Defaults to 2}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{matrix} whose rows correspond to topics and whose
j-th column corresponds to the j-th "best" label assignment.
}
\description{
Function calls \code{textmineR::GetProbableTerms()} with some 
rules to get topic labels. This function is in "super-ultra-mega alpha"; use
at your own risk/discretion.
}
\examples{
# Load a pre-formatted dtm and topic model
data(nih_sample_dtm)
data(nih_sample_topic_model) 

assignments <- t(apply(nih_sample_topic_model$theta, 1, function(x){
  x[ x < 0.05 ] <- 0
  x / sum(x)
}))

labels <- LabelTopics(assignments = assignments, dtm = nih_sample_dtm, M = 2)
